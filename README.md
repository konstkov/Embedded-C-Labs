# Embedded C Labs Portfolio

A collection of C language labs using the Raspberry Pi Pico, implementing communication protocols such as UART, I2C, and handling peripherals like LEDs and stepper motors.

# Contents

- [Lab 1: LED and PWM](lab1-gpio-pwm)
- [Lab 2: LED and Interrupts](lab2-gpio-interrupts)
- [Lab 3: Stepper Motor](lab3-stepper-motor)
- [Lab 4: UART and LoRaWAN](lab4-uart-lorawan)
- [Lab 5: I2C and EEPROM](lab5-i2c-eeprom)

## Highlights

- Implemented LED blinking using a debounce mechanism and Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)  
- Learned to use interrupt handlers for asynchronous LED control  
- Developed firmware for rotation and calibration of a stepper motor  
- Established wireless communication with a LoRaWAN module using UART  
- Designed firmware for writing and reading log messages from EEPROM using I2C
