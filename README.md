# Embedded C Labs Portfolio

A collection of labs in C language using Raspberry Pi Pico implementing communication protocols such as UART, I2C using interrupt handlers, controlling stepper motor and LEDs.

# Contents

- [Lab 1: LED and PWM](lab1-gpio-pwm)
- [Lab 2: LED and Interrupts](lab2-gpio-interrupts)
- [Lab 3: Stepper Motor](lab3-stepper-motor)
- [Lab 4: UART and LoRaWAN](lab4-uart-lorawan)
- [Lab 5: I2C and EEPROM](lab5-i2c-eeprom)

## Highlights

- Implemented LED blinking program using debounce mechanism and Pulse Width Modulation.
- Learned how to use interrupt handlers for asynchronous handling of LED logic.
- Developed firmware for rotation and calibration of stepper motor.
- Established wireless comunication with LoRaWAN module using UART protocol.
- Designed firmware for writing and reading log messages from EEPROM memory using I2C protocol.
